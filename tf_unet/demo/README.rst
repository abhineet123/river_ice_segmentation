Here you can find demo Jupyter notebooks for a `toy problem <https://github.com/jakeret/tf_unet/blob/master/demo/demo_toy_problem.ipynb>`_ or the `Radio Frequency Interference mitigation <https://github.com/jakeret/tf_unet/blob/master/demo/demo_radio_data.ipynb>`_ discussed in our paper.


You can use the binder badge to start an interactive version of the toy problem without having to install anything on your machine.
